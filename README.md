I am a Maker.

I build, modify, and improve on physical things.

I specialize in metal fabrication (many levels of skills) and am a pipe welder by trade.

I'm decently savvy and very interested in technology but still better with the physical things... 

Still interested with tech but now need better device security before i retire in the technological world and live with mother nature and her land.. 

I come here to feed interests but also to explore modifications towards making my device easier to use.
